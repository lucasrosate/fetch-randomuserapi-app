# Fetch Random User API

This is my first app in Next.js. That project fetches a random user from [here](https://randomuser.me/api) and generates random users and displays it.

### Technologies

- [Redux v4.0.5](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)
- [Axios v0.21.1](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [map-gl v2.0.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mapbox-gl)

2. Open the root folder via terminal or with VSCode.
3. Type ```yarn dev``` in the terminal.
4. Enjoy it!

### Todo
